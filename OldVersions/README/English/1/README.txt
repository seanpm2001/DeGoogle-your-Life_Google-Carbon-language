Why Carbon being a Google language is a problem

- It gives Google even further monopoly power (they already have strong ties with the Rust programming languages (being one of the 5 co-founders of the Rust foundations) along with ownership of Google Apps Script, Mojom, Google Go, Dart, LookML, V8 Torque, Blockly, Flutter, Starlark/Bazel, Sawzall, GSON, AngularJS, Jsonnet, MLIR, Protocol Buffers, and many others) (I just named 16 languages by Google that aren't Carbon, and I am still finding more)
- They are bound to add Telemetry at some point, like they did with Google Go
- It is better to have C++ exist than to have Google have yet another language be in the top programming language indexes, look at how many of the top 30 languages they control (Rust, Google Go, Dart)
- Google can discontinue Carbon at any point, for any reason (even for no reason at all) as Carbon isn't going to directly make them hundreds of millions of dollars per year like their ad-infested/privacy invading software. Look at their history of discontinuing popular/useful software, and you will see that not even Google Golang is safe (even though so many depend on it now) it may seem unlikely, but it is possible for these languages to just be dropped/merged on any day, I feel Carbon would be the first to go.

## Side notes

- Apple created a technology in 2001 known as Carbon, intended to act as an API for Classic MacOS programs to work on Mac OS X. Google named Carbon with this name 21 years later in 2022.
